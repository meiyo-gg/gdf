# Welcome to the Meiyo Game Development Framework
The Meiyo GDF is an open source framework that provides the tools and guidance for making all kinds of high quality video games with the Unity Engine. The framework is designed to make it easy for aspiring/idie game developers to make complex games with tools that are usually only accessible to developers/studios with greater than average resources. 

When aspiring game developers get started with Unity, they soon realise how much they need to learn before they can turn their idea into reality. The problem is that a lot of time is wasted _reinventing the wheel_; why spend time programming your own character controller when you can configure an existing one to meet your needs and move on to the next feature of your game? Of course, sometimes it is necessary to write custom scripts, but for many games the same tools can be reused to avoid wasting precious time.
